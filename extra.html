				Hello! I have many hobbies! 
                <br/>
                Something I love doing is lifting weights! This is very fun and it helps me concentrate on other things in my life. It has been medically proven that physical activity releases dopamine, so not only is it healthy, it makes you happy!
                <br/>
                I also enjoy playing cards with friends and family. I love playing poker because it requires a lot of mental concentration, and also involves a friendly atmosphere that is conducive to good conversation.
                <br/>
                I love reading books! This summer I read a book that was over 1,000 pages! I enjoy it, as I think it is the perfect activity to do before I go to bed!
