					<h3>The Alchemist</h3>
					<img class = "Cover" src="Images/TheAlchemist.jpeg" height=450 width=300 alt="The Alchemist Book Cover">
					<p>Following the journey of a young man who is finding his destiny in life, this book is full of great lessons while exploring a terrific plot. Set in ancient lands, it follows his travels through many foreign places and what he learns along the way. He meets with many interesting, wise characters. He also meets bad actors who try to detract him from his personal destiny. I would highly recommend this book for younger teens as level of word usage and story complexity is not too high. </p>

					<h3>Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</h3>
					<img class = "Cover" src="Images/ZeroToOne.jpeg" height=450 width=300 alt="Zero To One Book Cover">
					<p>Peter Thiel is a famous entrepreneur who was one of the founders of PayPal and Palantir and an investor in Facebook, Lyft, and Spotify, among others. In this world-renouned book, Thiel teaches the same lessons he taught to students at Stanford when he taught classes. Covered things such as how to go about creating a brand new company to how many shareholders to have, this bold book is a must read for entrepreneurs and businesspeople. </p>

					<h3>Atlas Shrugged</h3>
					<img class = "Cover" src="Images/AtlasShrugged.jpeg" height=450 width=300 alt="Atlas Shrugged Book Cover">
					<p> Atlas Shrugged is known by many as a classic and an example of the great American literature. Set in the American industrial revolution, this book follows several industrialist as the struggle against an incomptent, yet devious government. I recommend this novel for more skilled readers, usually above the age of 16. This book is very long (over 1,000 pages) and uses sophsicated words, complex symbolism, and an intricate plot. </p>

					<h3>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</h3>

					<p>Written by the famous philosopher and intellectual Jordan Peterson, this is a must read for anyone who is interested in reading self-help books. Serious and comedic at the right times, this book is known by many as helping them get out of a deep dark hole in their life, or simply helping others who are already doing well. With rules like, "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not others today" and "Tell the truth, or at least don't lie" this book imparts useful, age-old wisdom that gives useful ways for the reader to live life more virtously.</p>

					<h3>The Queen's Gambit</h3>
					<img class = "Cover" src="Images/Queen'sGambit.jpeg" height=450 width=300 alt="The Queen's Gambit Book Cover">
					<p>The Queen's Gambit is an inspiring novel for chess and non-chess players. Recenlty made into a hit Netflix original TV show, this novel follows the story of Beth Harmon as she advances in her knowledge and skill playing chess. With inspiring coming of age scenes, I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 16, because of some explicit content.</p>
