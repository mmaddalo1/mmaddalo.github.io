				What is a business that you can start over the summer to make good money while learning a good work ethic? 
				My answer was a window cleaning company! I started my own business and registered it as <i>Michael's Window Cleaning LLC</i>. 
				It was a very enjoyable time and I learned a little bit about the value of hard work. 
				I spent around 8 hours a day 3-4 days a week in the Florida sun while cleaning my neighbors houses' windows and local business office windows. 
				I used mops, squeegees, extension poles, abrasive cloths for stubborn dirt, an extension ladder, and a special cleaning solution to destroy the most dirty of windows! 
				My brother joined me on a few jobs to increase our efficiency. I purchased insurance to protect my clients, my brother, and myself. 
				The insurance only covered up to 30 feet, so I could not clean any windows above the third floor. 
				I had around 7 clients this summer and averaged around $600 per a job. My costs included equipment, LLC registration, monthly insurance, and wages to my brother. 
				I really enjoyed starting this company and I look forward to starting another one soon!
